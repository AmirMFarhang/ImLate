# Mqtt Hints

The executable needs to be connected to a broker in order to send and receive MQTT messages.

## Connecting the executable to a broker
You can:

- Install a MQTT broker on your local machine, for this we recommend downloading the Mosquitto broker
- Install a MQTT broker on another machine (i.e.your smartphone?). For that you can donwload an app or another broker.
- Use an existing (online) free broker. Here is one: `broker.hivemq.com:1883`.

For the two latter cases, you will need to set the ip and the port inside the game. When you try to connect the game could
freeze for some seconds. Don't panic, its normal!
