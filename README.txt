Hello,

I wrote a littel broker using swoole/php its simple and need many changes and improvemnets.
mq.py file is my controller, its simple to work with:

up for increasing velocity down for decreasing.
left for decreasing angel and right for increasing it.
s for stopping rover (setting velocity to 0) 
a for setting angel to 0
r for resseting rover setting
f for force resset.

it an be better, I just read about DIANA 17th october and saw this challenge 18th :)
If I had enough time I would add rotate and speed safely and monitoring option.
I rather reprogramm it with c++ and even give it a UI using qt.

I tried to use simulation but it just crash when it connect to any mqtt broket whether it is mine or a public server like you provided.

in python code it is going to connect to my broker (194.5.195.209) you can change it.
